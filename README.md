# burger
An application that will log the exact burger you'd like to eat using Node, Express, MySQL and Handlebars.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side (Eat me!) of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move below to the "Devoured!" section of the page.
